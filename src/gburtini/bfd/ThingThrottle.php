  *		$name - a token for the element, function or method that this SessionThrottle instance is protecting
  *		$storage - an instance of a storage class such as SessionStorage or MemcacheStorage. The selected storage interface must provide three methods (store(name, value), get(name), delete(name)) and has security implications you should understand before chosing.
  * 	$shape - an instance of a shaping class such as ExponentialShape, which provides a method timeout($i) that computes a timeout for the $ith failure.
  *		$sleep - true/false for whether ->test() should ATTEMPT to always return true (by simply sleeping until the timelimit has passed).
  *				NOTE: even if sleep is true, the sleep may get interrupted and thus return false. You must ccheck it.
  *
  * Example use:
  * $login_limit = new ThingThrottle("login_bob", new APCStorage("login"), new ExponentialShape());	// can have "login" throttles or "login_%username%" throttles... or even just an expensive process can be throttled by this.
  *	if($login_limit->test()) {
  * 		if(!checkLogin($user, $pass)) {
  *			$login_limit->fail();
  *		} else {
  *			$login_limit->succeed(); // clear the timelimit
  *		}
